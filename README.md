Basic kineticist with some tweaks and using Charisma instead of CON.
Regarding spell casting, they get up to level 6 spells normally and up to 9 if merging.
Spells up to level 6 are from the Bard class; 7, 8 and 9 are from Shaman.
Spells above 6 only start showing up at caster level 21.
They can merge with Angels/Lich/Azata. (Azata needs Geo Enchanter installed, as it piggybacks of the "AzataIncorporateSpellbook" from there.)
